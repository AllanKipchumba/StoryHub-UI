# StoryHub

StoryHub is a simple website where people can publish and access previously published content. To access the information, you must first log into the system. Users who do not have an account can sign up and log in with their email address and password. Once authenticated, the user can read posts made by other users and publish their own. The user can narrow down the posts they want to read by category. They could also filter the posts so that they can see all of the posts by a particular author in a single display.

## Technologies Used

This project gave me the opportunity to hone both my front end and backend skills. React, Redux, React persistence, Tailwind, and Sass are the frontend technologies used in the project. The front end is currently in active development on Vercel and Netlify. The project's backend technologies include Node, Express, Mongoose, JWT tokens, and MongoDB Atlas for cloud data storage.
